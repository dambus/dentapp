- Removed the default Vite starter screen, starter app CSS, and unused starter assets.
- Added a temporary DentApp-branded Tailwind verification screen for Phase 1.
- Confirmed the production build succeeds after Tailwind setup.
- Created the initial `src/` folder structure from the technical architecture: `app`, `assets`, `components`, `features`, `hooks`, `layouts`, `lib`, `pages`, `routes`, `services`, `styles`, and `types`.
- Added `.gitkeep` markers for empty source structure folders.
- Preserved the temporary DentApp Tailwind verification screen while preparing the app for future routing and layout work.
- Confirmed build and lint succeed after source folder setup.
- Installed `react-router-dom`.
- Configured initial React Router routing with `BrowserRouter`, `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`, and `src/routes/routePaths.ts`.
- Created placeholder route pages for login, dashboard, calendar, patients, treatment plans, payments, doctor commissions, inventory, reports, settings, and not found.
- Preserved Tailwind styling on all placeholder routes.
- Confirmed build, lint, and local route checks succeed after routing setup.

### Current Project State

The project is in Phase 1 — App Foundation.

Tailwind CSS is configured and verified with a temporary DentApp screen. No business features have been implemented yet.

The required Phase 1 source folder structure now exists. Initial React Router routes and placeholder pages are configured. App shell, navigation, protected routes, and business modules have not been implemented yet.

The next focus is to continue Phase 1 foundation work without adding business features.

### Current Stack Decision

Initial stack:

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured
- React Router configured
- Supabase planned
- PostgreSQL planned
- Supabase Auth planned
- Supabase Storage planned

### Build Status

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- `npm run lint` succeeds.
- `npm run dev` serves the configured placeholder routes locally.

### Key Product Decisions So Far

- Project working name: DentApp
- Initial market: Serbia
- Initial user type: one dental practice with multiple doctors
- Initial use: internal use only
- Pilot: real dental practice pilot
- Patient portal: later phase
- Online booking: later phase
- Core focus: treatment plans, patient records, payments, doctor commission, inventory
- Architecture should be multi-tenant ready from day one
- Real patient data must not be used in repository or documentation

### Next Recommended Work

1. Define initial data model v1.
2. Define technical architecture.
3. Define Supabase schema strategy.
4. Define UX screen map.
5. Define implementation roadmap.
6. Prepare Phase 1 implementation checklist.
7. Continue Phase 1 with app shell, sidebar navigation, top bar, and page layout components.

## Notes

This project should remain structured and incremental.

Do not start coding application features until the core discovery and planning documents are sufficiently defined.
